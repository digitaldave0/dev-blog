# Understanding GitHub Actions: A Complete Guide

GitHub Actions is a powerful continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your software development workflows right from your GitHub repository. In this guide, we'll explore what GitHub Actions is, how to set it up, and understand its different pricing tiers.

## What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a workflow automation tool that helps you build, test, and deploy your code directly from your GitHub repository. It supports workflows that can be triggered by various GitHub events such as:

- Push events
- Pull request events
- Issue creation/modification
- Scheduled events
- Manual triggers
- External events via webhooks

## Basic Setup

Getting started with GitHub Actions is straightforward:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

2. Create a workflow file (e.g., `ci.yml`):

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up environment
        run: echo "Setting up environment"
      - name: Run tests
        run: echo "Running tests"
```

This basic workflow will run on pushes and pull requests to the main branch.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Workflows

- YAML files in `.github/workflows`
- Define when and how your automation runs
- Can have multiple workflows per repository

### 2. Events

- Triggers that start your workflow
- Examples: push, pull_request, schedule
- Can combine multiple events

### 3. Jobs

- Sets of steps that execute on the same runner
- Can run in parallel or sequentially
- Each job runs in a fresh virtual environment

### 4. Steps

- Individual tasks within a job
- Can run commands or use actions
- Share data between steps using artifacts

## Pricing Tiers (as of July 2025)

### Free Tier (GitHub Free)

- 2,000 minutes/month for public repositories
- 500 minutes/month for private repositories
- Linux runners only
- Perfect for small projects and open source

### Team Tier (GitHub Team)

- 3,000 minutes/month for private repositories
- Access to Linux, Windows, and macOS runners
- Advanced security features
- Suitable for small teams

### Enterprise Tier (GitHub Enterprise)

- 50,000 minutes/month
- Priority support
- Advanced security and compliance features
- Self-hosted runners
- Enterprise-grade permissions

### Additional Minutes

- Can purchase additional minutes if needed
- Pricing varies by runner type:
  - Linux: $0.008 per minute
  - Windows: $0.016 per minute
  - macOS: $0.024 per minute

## Best Practices

1. **Cache Dependencies**
   {% raw %}

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/cache@v3
    with:
      path: ~/.npm
      key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
```

{% endraw %}

2. **Use Matrix Builds**
   {% raw %}

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
```

{% endraw %}

3. **Reuse Workflows**
   {% raw %}

```yaml
jobs:
  reusable_workflow_job:
    uses: octo-org/example-repo/.github/workflows/workflow_file.yml@main
```

{% endraw %}

## Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Minimize Build Time**

   - Use build caching
   - Only run workflows when necessary
   - Optimize Docker images

2. **Self-hosted Runners**

   - Consider for high-volume projects
   - Can be more cost-effective
   - Requires maintenance overhead

3. **Conditional Jobs**
   {% raw %}

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

{% endraw %}

## Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Management**

   - Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets
   - Never print secrets in logs
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Permissions**
   {% raw %}

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
```

{% endraw %}

3. **Third-party Actions**
   - Use verified actions when possible
   - Pin actions to specific versions
   - Review action source code

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions provides a powerful, flexible platform for automation that can scale with your needs. Whether you're working on a small open-source project or managing enterprise-level deployments, there's a tier that fits your requirements. The key is to understand your workflow needs and optimize your usage according to your tier limits.

Remember to monitor your minutes usage and implement cost optimization strategies as your projects grow. With proper setup and management, GitHub Actions can significantly improve your development workflow and team productivity.
