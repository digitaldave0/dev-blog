# Building a Free-Tier AI Chatbot with Netlify and Hugging Face

Over the past week, I spent about 4 hours building a proof-of-concept AI chatbot that demonstrates how to leverage free-tier services to create a functional AI assistant. In this post, I'll share my experience, explain the technical decisions, and outline the security considerations.

## Tech Stack Overview

- **Frontend**: Static HTML/JS/CSS with a cyberpunk theme
- **Backend**: Netlify Serverless Functions (Node.js)
- **AI Model**: Hugging Face's Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct (via Inference API)
- **Hosting**: Netlify (frontend + functions) + GitHub Pages (main blog)

## Why These Tools?

1. **Netlify + Serverless Functions**:
   - Free tier includes generous function invocations
   - Built-in environment variable management for API keys
   - Easy deployment and version control integration
   - Zero server maintenance

2. **Hugging Face Inference API**:
   - Free access to state-of-the-art models
   - Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct offers excellent performance
   - Simple REST API integration
   - Reasonable rate limits for demo purposes

3. **Static Frontend**:
   - Fast loading and minimal hosting costs
   - Easy to maintain and modify
   - Works well with Netlify's CDN

## Security Considerations

Security was a top priority in this project. Here's how I handled it:

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - Hugging Face API key stored as Netlify environment variable
   - Never exposed to client-side code
   - All API calls handled server-side in Netlify Functions

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Implemented basic session-based usage tracking
   - Token counting to stay within free tier limits
   - Error handling for API limits and failures

## Build Process

1. Set up Netlify project structure:
   ```
   netlify-chatbot/
   ├── netlify/
   │   └── functions/
   │       └── chatbot.js
   ├── public/
   │   └── index.html
   └── netlify.toml
   ```

2. Created serverless function for Hugging Face API integration
3. Built cyberpunk-themed UI with usage stats
4. Added technical documentation section
5. Deployed and tested on Netlify
6. Integrated with main Jekyll blog

## Future Improvements

I'm planning several enhancements:

1. **RAG Integration**:
   - Add Pinecone for vector storage
   - Implement document embedding
   - Enable context-aware responses

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Conversation history storage
   - Multiple model support
   - Custom prompt templates

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Stream responses
   - Implement client-side caching
   - Add response compression

## Try It Yourself!

You can try the live demo [here](https://685c15ab20f6a100080ad1af--funny-bienenstitch-0c3a88.netlify.app/) or check out the technical documentation section on the demo page for implementation details.

## Time Investment

The entire project took approximately 4 hours:
- 1 hour: Research and planning
- 1.5 hours: Backend implementation and API integration
- 1 hour: Frontend development and styling
- 0.5 hours: Testing, debugging, and deployment

## Cost Analysis

Everything in this implementation is using free tiers:
- Netlify: Free tier (includes 125k function invocations/month)
- Hugging Face: Free tier API access
- GitHub Pages: Free hosting for the blog

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how modern cloud services and AI APIs can be combined to create sophisticated applications with minimal cost. The key is choosing the right tools and implementing proper security measures from the start.
