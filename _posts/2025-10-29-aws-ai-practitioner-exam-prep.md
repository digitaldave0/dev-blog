French:"

# Chain-of-thought
"Solve this math problem step by step:
If a train travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, then 40 mph for 3 hours, what is the average speed?
First, calculate distance at 60 mph: 60 * 2 = 120 miles
Then distance at 40 mph: 40 * 3 = 120 miles
Total distance: 120 + 120 = 240 miles
Total time: 2 + 3 = 5 hours
Average speed: 240 / 5 = 48 mph"
