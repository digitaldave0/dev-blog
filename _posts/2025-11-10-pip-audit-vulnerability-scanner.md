# pip-audit: Scanning Python Dependencies for Known Vulnerabilities

In today's software development landscape, securing your application's dependencies is crucial. Python developers often rely on numerous third-party packages, which can introduce security vulnerabilities. **pip-audit** is a powerful tool designed to scan Python environments for packages with known vulnerabilities, helping developers identify and mitigate potential security risks.

## What is pip-audit?

pip-audit is a command-line tool that audits Python environments for packages with known vulnerabilities. It leverages vulnerability databases like the Python Packaging Advisory Database (PyPI) and the Open Source Vulnerability (OSV) database to identify packages that have reported security issues.

The tool was created by the Python Packaging Authority and is maintained as part of the PyPA ecosystem, ensuring it stays current with the latest security advisories.

## When to Use pip-audit

pip-audit should be integrated into your development workflow at several key points:

- **During Development**: Regularly scan your local environment to catch vulnerabilities early
- **Before Deployment**: Include in your CI/CD pipeline to prevent deploying vulnerable code
- **Dependency Updates**: Run after updating packages to verify no new vulnerabilities were introduced
- **Code Reviews**: Use as part of security-focused code review processes
- **Compliance Checks**: For organizations requiring regular security assessments

## How to Use pip-audit

### Installation

pip-audit requires Python 3.9 or newer. Install it using pip:

```bash
python -m pip install pip-audit
```

For CI/CD environments, you can also use the official GitHub Action:

```yaml
- uses: pypa/gh-action-pip-audit@v1.0.0
  with:
    inputs: requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

#### Scanning Your Environment

To scan all installed packages in your current Python environment:

```bash
pip-audit
```

This will check all packages in your environment against known vulnerability databases.

#### Scanning Requirements Files

For project-specific audits, scan requirements files:

```bash
pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```

You can specify multiple requirements files:

```bash
pip-audit -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
```

#### Scanning Local Projects

To audit a local Python project:

```bash
pip-audit /path/to/your/project
```

Or from within the project directory:

```bash
pip-audit .
```

#### Scanning Lock Files

For more precise audits, use lock files:

```bash
pip-audit --locked .
```

This ensures you're auditing the exact versions specified in your lock files.

### Advanced Usage

#### Output Formats

pip-audit supports multiple output formats:

```bash
# Default columnar format
pip-audit

# JSON output for automation
pip-audit -f json

# Markdown format for documentation
pip-audit -f markdown

# CycloneDX SBOM format
pip-audit -f cyclonedx-json
```

#### Including Descriptions and Aliases

Get more detailed information about vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Include vulnerability descriptions
pip-audit --desc

# Include CVE/GHSA aliases
pip-audit --aliases
```

#### Filtering Results

Focus on specific issues or exclude certain vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Ignore specific vulnerabilities
pip-audit --ignore-vuln PYSEC-2019-179

# Scan only local packages (exclude system packages)
pip-audit --local
```

#### Automatic Fixes

pip-audit can automatically upgrade vulnerable packages:

```bash
pip-audit --fix
```

This will attempt to upgrade packages to secure versions. Use `--dry-run` to preview changes:

```bash
pip-audit --fix --dry-run
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Environment Scan

```bash
$ pip-audit
No known vulnerabilities found
```

### Example 2: Scanning with Vulnerabilities Present

```bash
$ pip-audit
Found 2 known vulnerabilities in 1 package
Name  Version ID             Fix Versions
----  ------- -------------- ------------
Flask 0.5     PYSEC-2019-179 1.0
Flask 0.5     PYSEC-2018-66  0.12.3
```

### Example 3: JSON Output for CI/CD

```bash
$ pip-audit -f json | jq .
[
  {
    "name": "flask",
    "version": "0.5",
    "vulns": [
      {
        "id": "PYSEC-2019-179",
        "fix_versions": ["1.0"],
        "aliases": ["CVE-2019-1010083", "GHSA-5wv5-4vpf-pj6m"],
        "description": "The Pallets Project Flask before 1.0 is affected by unexpected memory usage..."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Example 4: CI/CD Integration

Here's how to integrate pip-audit into a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: Security Audit
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run pip-audit
        run: pip-audit
```

## What pip-audit Helps Mitigate

pip-audit helps protect against several types of security threats:

### 1. Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies

- **SQL Injection**: Vulnerable versions of ORM libraries
