# Data Science Fundamentals: Getting Your Data Right

Before diving into fancy algorithms and complex models, there's something even more important: your data. As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out." Let's learn how to prepare your data properly and avoid common pitfalls.

## The Data Preparation Pipeline

### 1. Data Cleaning Basics
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('raw_data.csv')

# Basic cleaning steps
df = df.dropna()  # Remove missing values
df = df.drop_duplicates()  # Remove exact duplicates
```

### 2. Understanding Deduplication

#### What is Deduplication?
Deduplication is removing redundant data points that might skew your model's learning:

- **Exact Duplicates**: Identical rows in your dataset
- **Near Duplicates**: Very similar entries that represent the same information
- **Semantic Duplicates**: Different representations of the same thing

#### Example: Customer Data Deduplication
```python
def normalize_text(text):
    """Basic text normalization"""
    return str(text).lower().strip()

# Create normalized versions of key fields
df['name_normalized'] = df['name'].apply(normalize_text)
df['email_normalized'] = df['email'].apply(normalize_text)

# Find similar entries using fuzzy matching
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
def find_similar_entries(df, threshold=80):
    similar_pairs = []
    for i in range(len(df)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(df)):
            similarity = fuzz.ratio(
                df.iloc[i]['name_normalized'],
                df.iloc[j]['name_normalized']
            )
            if similarity > threshold:
                similar_pairs.append((i, j, similarity))
    return similar_pairs
```

### 3. Feature Scaling and Normalization

Different scales can bias your model:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler

# Standardization (mean=0, std=1)
scaler = StandardScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df[numeric_columns])

# Normalization (0-1 range)
normalizer = MinMaxScaler()
df_normalized = normalizer.fit_transform(df[numeric_columns])
```

## The Train-Test-Validation Split

### Why Split Your Data?
Imagine studying for an exam using the actual test questions - that's cheating! Similarly, testing your model on training data doesn't prove it can handle new data.

### The Right Way to Split
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# First split: training and temporary test set
X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

# Second split: create validation and test sets
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42
)

print(f"Training set size: {len(X_train)}")
print(f"Validation set size: {len(X_val)}")
print(f"Test set size: {len(X_test)}")
```

### The Golden Rule: No Leakage!
‚ùå **Wrong**:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
scaler.fit(X)  # Fitting on all data
X_scaled = scaler.transform(X)
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, ...)
```

‚úÖ **Right**:
```python
# DO THIS
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(X, ...)
scaler.fit(X_train)  # Fit only on training data
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

## Understanding Model Fit

### 1. Underfitting: When Your Model Is Too Simple
Think of it like trying to draw a circle using only straight lines.

**Signs of Underfitting:**
- Poor performance on training data
- Poor performance on test data
- Model is too simple for the problem

```python
# Example: Linear model trying to fit non-linear data
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()  # Might underfit if data is non-linear
```

### 2. Just Right: The Goldilocks Zone
Your model learns the patterns without memorizing the noise.

**Signs of Good Fit:**
- Good performance on training data
- Similar performance on test data
- Model complexity matches problem complexity

```python
# Example: Using cross-validation to verify
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
print(f"Mean CV Score: {scores.mean():.3f} (+/- {scores.std() * 2:.3f})")
```

### 3. Overfitting: When Your Model Memorizes
Like memorizing test answers without understanding the subject.

**Signs of Overfitting:**
- Excellent performance on training data
- Poor performance on test data
- Model is too complex

```python
# Example: Decision tree without proper pruning
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Likely to overfit
complex_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=None)

# Better balanced
balanced_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
```

## Visual Diagnosis

Here's how to visualize model fit:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_learning_curves(model, X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val):
    train_sizes = np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10)
    train_scores = []
    val_scores = []
    
    for size in train_sizes:
        # Train on subset
        subset_size = int(len(X_train) * size)
        model.fit(X_train[:subset_size], y_train[:subset_size])
        
        # Record scores
        train_scores.append(model.score(X_train[:subset_size], 
                                      y_train[:subset_size]))
        val_scores.append(model.score(X_val, y_val))
    
    plt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores, 'b-', label='Training score')
    plt.plot(train_sizes, val_scores, 'r-', label='Validation score')
    plt.xlabel('Training set size')
    plt.ylabel('Score')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Clean and deduplicate your data before modeling

3. Watch for signs of underfitting and overfitting
4. Start simple and increase complexity only when needed
5. Use cross-validation to verify your model's performance

Remember: A well-prepared dataset and proper validation strategy are often more important than choosing the "perfect" algorithm!
