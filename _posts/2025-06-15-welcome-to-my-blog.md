# 🛠️ How I Set Up This Blog Using GitHub Pages & Jekyll

Setting up this blog was simpler than you’d think — and **completely free**. Here’s how I did it:

## 🍥 The Stack
- **GitHub Pages** for free static hosting  
- **Jekyll** (via [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)) for simple blog templating  
- **Markdown** for writing posts  
- **Custom domain** via [is-a.dev](https://is-a.dev)

## 🗺️ Step-by-Step Setup
1. **Forked a Jekyll template repo**  
   I used [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) — it’s clean, simple, and requires no local Ruby setup.
2. **Renamed the repo**  
   Called it `dev-blog` for clarity and easier GitHub Pages routing.
3. **Enabled GitHub Pages**  
   Under `Settings > Pages`, selected source: `master` branch, root folder.
4. **Customized `_config.yml`**  
   Changed site title, description, footer links, and theme.
5. **Wrote this post**  
   Using Markdown in `_posts/2025-06-15-welcome-to-my-blog.md`.
