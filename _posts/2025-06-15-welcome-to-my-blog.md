description: "A quick guide to how I set up my blog using GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and is-a.dev"

Setting up this blog was simpler than you’d think — and **completely free**. Here’s how I did it:

## 🍥 The Stack
- **GitHub Pages** for free static hosting  
- **Jekyll** (via [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now))  
- **Markdown** for writing posts  
- **Custom domain** via [is-a.dev](https://is-a.dev)

## 🗺️ Step-by-Step Setup
1. **Forked a Jekyll template repo**  
   Used [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
2. **Renamed the repo** to `dev-blog`
3. **Enabled GitHub Pages** under Settings → Pages
4. **Edited `_config.yml`** for name, description, links
5. **Created this post** using Markdown in `_posts/`
