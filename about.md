This blog is my digital notebook — a place where I jot down my thoughts, lessons, and experiments from my journey through DevOps, MLOps, and automation.

## Purpose

I use this space to capture ideas, code snippets, and technical discoveries that might help others (and future me) solve real-world problems faster.

## Topics

You’ll find posts on:
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Terraform, Serverless)
- CI/CD pipelines and automation
- Learning experiments in AI/MLOps
- Tools
